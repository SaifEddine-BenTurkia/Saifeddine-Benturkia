ðŸš€ ICT Engineering Student @ SUP'COM | Passionate about AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Hey there! I'm an ICT engineering student at SUP'COM with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Currently, I'm diving deep into Reinforcement Learning (RL) and working on a hands-on project in this exciting field. My interests also extend to Computer Vision and Deep RL, where I love turning complex problems into creative solutions.

Beyond AI, I have a solid foundation in embedded systemsâ€”blending hardware and software for smarter tech.

ðŸŽ¨ Fun Fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me expressing my creativity as a part-time graphic designer, video editor, brand strategist, and photographer.

**Catchphrase:**  
_"Coding the future, framing the present."_

Stay tuned for my project links & portfolioâ€”coming soon!
